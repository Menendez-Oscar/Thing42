[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guygrigsby/Thing42.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guygrigsby/Thing42)

Build and Test Instructions:

The default Ant target for the included build.xml script will compile and test all code for the Thing42 project. 
Additional targets that may be of use are "jar", which creates a jar named ./Thing42.jar, and "doc" which builds 
the javadocs in ./doc.
